# ROSALIND-solutions
The [ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) problem set is a list of coding challenges designed to introduce college students to bioinformatics and coding. In this repo you will find solutions to the ROSALIND challenges written as well-documented code that I have created as I learn more about bioinformatics.

## Structure
Each Python filename references the problem name, but the link to the problem can be found at the top of each file.
